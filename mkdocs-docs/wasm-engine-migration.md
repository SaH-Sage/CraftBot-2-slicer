# Migrating a client frontend to the current WASM engine

This guide is for a client frontend that still downloads the original
`wasm-v2.4.2` release without a `-patchN` suffix.

The version distinction matters:

- **OrcaSlicer version:** still `v2.4.2`.
- **Primary product build:** the current multithreaded build is
  `wasm-v2.4.2-patch13-multithreaded`.
- **Compatibility fallback:** the current single-threaded build is
  `wasm-v2.4.2-patch12`.

The patch suffix is an immutable OrcaWeb build revision. It is not a new
upstream OrcaSlicer version, and the `-patchN` counter is independent from the
`-multithreaded` release family. This page was checked on **2026-08-01**.

## Target release matrix

| Use case | Release tag | Files | Runtime requirements |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Primary product deployment** | [`wasm-v2.4.2-patch13-multithreaded`](https://github.com/Hiosdra/OrcaWeb/releases/tag/wasm-v2.4.2-patch13-multithreaded) | `slicer-mt.js`, `slicer-mt.wasm` | `crossOriginIsolated === true`, COOP/COEP headers, and `SharedArrayBuffer` |
| Compatibility fallback | [`wasm-v2.4.2-patch12`](https://github.com/Hiosdra/OrcaWeb/releases/tag/wasm-v2.4.2-patch12) | `slicer.js`, `slicer.wasm` | Works on ordinary static hosting; no `SharedArrayBuffer` required |

Use MT as the product path. Keep ST available as a fallback for hosts that
cannot provide cross-origin isolation. Never combine the JavaScript glue from
one release with the `.wasm` file from another release; the ST and MT release
families are independent and must each be downloaded as a matching pair.

## 1. Pin and download a matching artifact pair

Prefer downloading the files during the frontend build and serving them from
the same origin as the app. Do not make the browser resolve a GitHub `latest`
URL at runtime: release assets are immutable, and a floating URL makes cache
and rollback behaviour difficult to reason about.

For the primary MT engine:

```bash
ENGINE_TAG="wasm-v2.4.2-patch13-multithreaded"
ENGINE_BASE="https://github.com/Hiosdra/OrcaWeb/releases/download/${ENGINE_TAG}"

mkdir -p public/wasm
curl --fail --location "${ENGINE_BASE}/slicer-mt.js" \
  --output public/wasm/slicer-mt.js
curl --fail --location "${ENGINE_BASE}/slicer-mt.wasm" \
  --output public/wasm/slicer-mt.wasm
```

Current headless builds do **not** publish `slicer.data`; do not carry over an
old `slicer.data` download from a previous frontend integration.

Verify the primary MT pair before committing or publishing it:

```bash
printf '%s  %s\n' \
  '680e1b6941e79c56aff030d8596387e16831a15ebe7f2c73fb56552e0b456626' \
  public/wasm/slicer-mt.js \
  '3260641412d7fb096aec677a6d1c5fbcb8b91e9e5ae9434472612395bd428b37' \
  public/wasm/slicer-mt.wasm | sha256sum --check
```

If the client must also work on a non-isolated host, ship the ST fallback pair:

```bash
ST_TAG="wasm-v2.4.2-patch12"
ST_BASE="https://github.com/Hiosdra/OrcaWeb/releases/download/${ST_TAG}"

curl --fail --location "${ST_BASE}/slicer.js" \
  --output public/wasm/slicer.js
curl --fail --location "${ST_BASE}/slicer.wasm" \
  --output public/wasm/slicer.wasm

printf '%s  %s\n' \
  '800a7dda56254f426cc84b48fb9a818daf2ea84b20d04e01bf2ced37e7f65bb2' \
  public/wasm/slicer.js \
  '8d481d1b1f7050b8acac2e28f812ca3fb0d130bf0720d2dc13d4934420ab88e7' \
  public/wasm/slicer.wasm | sha256sum --check
```

The release assets are the authoritative source for the current digests and
sizes. Refresh this page's target tags and hashes when selecting a later
release.

## 2. Update the loader and cache key

The loader should try the MT pair first and use the ST pair only as fallback.
Keep the base directory fixed and append the same cache key to every engine
asset:

```typescript
const engineBase = `${import.meta.env.BASE_URL}wasm`
const engineLabel = 'v2.4.2-patch13-multithreaded'
// Inject this at build time from the deployed artifact set. For an MT-only
// deployment, the first 16 hex characters of slicer-mt.wasm are
// 3260641412d7fb09. When both variants are deployed, use the combined digest
// shown below instead.
const engineBuild = import.meta.env.VITE_WASM_VERSION

const engineUrl = (file: string) => `${engineBase}/${file}?v=${engineBuild}`

// Primary product path
const mtJsUrl = engineUrl('slicer-mt.js')
const mtWasmUrl = engineUrl('slicer-mt.wasm')

// Compatibility fallback
const stJsUrl = engineUrl('slicer.js')
const stWasmUrl = engineUrl('slicer.wasm')
```

The query parameter is intentional. The filenames are stable, so a
service-worker `CacheFirst` entry keyed only by `/wasm/slicer.wasm` can keep
serving the old base release forever. The key can be the first 16 hexadecimal
characters of the SHA-256 digest, as above, or another value that changes for
every binary build.

If the frontend has a service worker, update its cache strategy at the same
time:

1. Cache the new `?v=` URLs.
2. Remove the old fixed-URL entries during activation, or let the changed URL
   create a new cache entry and explicitly delete the old cache on the next
   release.
3. Test once with an existing installation, not only in a clean browser
   profile.

`engine-version.json` is optional for an independent client. If the loader uses
the same runtime manifest convention as OrcaWeb, publish it beside the files:

```json
{
  "label": "v2.4.2-patch13-multithreaded",
  "version": "<cache-key-for-the-deployed-artifact-set>",
  "primaryVariant": "mt",
  "fallbackVariant": "st"
}
```

The manifest must not be cached longer than the engine deployment decision;
the engine files themselves may remain immutable and long-lived in cache.

If both ST and MT are published, derive the cache key from both deployed WASM
files, so a change to either variant produces a new URL. Use a deterministic
order and include the bytes, not the individual hash strings:

```bash
cat public/wasm/slicer.wasm public/wasm/slicer-mt.wasm \
  | sha256sum | cut -c1-16
```

This is the convention used by OrcaWeb's production deploy. Do not use the
MT-only digest when the fallback files are also part of the deployment.

## 3. Keep the browser loading contract

The release contains Emscripten glue (`slicer-mt.js` for the primary path,
`slicer.js` for the fallback) as a CommonJS-style IIFE, not a browser-native ES
module. A browser frontend must therefore either:

- use the existing worker loader pattern from the
  [Integration Guide](integration.md#loading-slicerjs-without-a-bundler), or
- load the glue as text, append an ES-module export in a Blob URL, and give the
  factory the matching `.wasm` location.

Do not import either glue file directly through Vite and assume that its
relative `.wasm` lookup will work after bundling. Keep the engine in a Web
Worker (or a Node worker thread); slicing is synchronous inside the WASM call
and blocks the calling worker.

For a same-origin deployment, check that the server returns:

| File | Required response |
|---|---|
| `slicer-mt.js` / `slicer.js` | `200`, JavaScript content type |
| `slicer-mt.wasm` / `slicer.wasm` | `200`, `Content-Type: application/wasm` |

An SPA fallback that returns `index.html` with status `200` is still an engine
load failure. Check the response body and content type, not just `response.ok`.

## 4. Verify the bridge contract before changing application code

The current ST and MT artifacts expose the same C bridge. A patch release does
not require an application-level API rewrite. The important calls are:

| Operation | Export |
|---|---|
| Create and destroy state | `_orc_session_create`, `_orc_session_destroy` |
| Initialise a session | `_orc_init` |
| Slice one STL | `_orc_slice` |
| Arrange and slice multiple STLs | `_orc_slice_multi` |
| Auto-orient or arrange a current plate | `_orc_prepare_plate` |
| Convert OBJ or STEP to STL | `_orc_obj_to_stl`, `_orc_cad_to_stl` |
| Read or write mesh/config 3MF | `_orc_read_3mf`, `_orc_write_3mf` |
| Read errors and release bridge buffers | `_orc_decode_exception`, `_orc_free` |

If the old client wrapper predates the session-based bridge, migrate these
rules while changing the artifact pin:

1. Create one non-zero session after the module loads and reuse it for
   `_orc_init`, `_orc_slice`, `_orc_slice_multi`, and `_orc_write_3mf`.
2. Pass the session as the first argument to those calls.
3. Free bridge-returned buffers with `_orc_free`; destroy the session with
   `_orc_session_destroy`, not `_free`.
4. Keep OBJ/STEP conversion and 3MF-read error decoding sessionless where the
   [API Reference](api-reference.md) specifies a `0` session.

The optional current bridge keys for adaptive layer height are:

```json
{
  "adaptive_layer_height": true,
  "adaptive_layer_height_quality": 0.5
}
```

They are bridge pseudo-keys, not upstream OrcaSlicer options. Existing clients
can omit them and retain the previous fixed-layer-height behaviour.

## 5. Select MT first and fall back safely

MT is the primary product path, but it still needs a runtime capability check.
The page must send these headers on the document and worker responses:

```http
Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin
Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: require-corp
```

The MT candidate is eligible when all of the following are true:

```typescript
const canUseMt =
  typeof SharedArrayBuffer !== 'undefined' &&
  globalThis.crossOriginIsolated === true

const preferredVariant = canUseMt ? 'slicer-mt' : 'slicer'
```

Also probe that `slicer-mt.js` really exists and is JavaScript. A missing asset
served as an HTML SPA fallback must select ST, not be passed to the ESM loader.
If MT is unavailable, fall back to `slicer.js`/`slicer.wasm` without showing an
engine error. On the isolated product host, a successful probe should therefore
load `slicer-mt.js`/`slicer-mt.wasm`; ST is the compatibility path.

Do not fetch the MT files directly from GitHub Releases from a COEP-isolated
page. The release download redirects do not provide the CORS/CORP response
needed by that page. Mirror the files onto a host you control, serve them with
the required CORS policy, and keep the pthread worker script same-origin or
use the Blob URL approach from the existing loader. See
[ADR-011](adr/adr-011-multithreaded-engine.md).

## 6. Run the migration smoke test

Before switching production traffic, verify both a cold browser and an
existing service-worker installation:

- the isolated product host loads the pinned release's `slicer-mt.js` and
  `slicer-mt.wasm` first, while a non-isolated host loads the ST fallback;
- no request uses `wasm-v2.4.2` without a suffix;
- both files return `200` and the expected content types, with no HTML body;
- the worker reaches `WASM_LOADED` and the UI reports the new engine label;
- `_orc_session_create()` returns a handle, `_orc_init()` returns `0`, and a
  small STL produces non-empty G-code;
- every output pointer returned by the bridge is released with `_orc_free()`;
- OBJ, STEP, 3MF, multi-file, and cancellation paths are tested if the client
  exposes them;
- an existing installed PWA updates its engine after the cache-key change;
- MT completes one slice on an isolated host and falls back to ST on a normal
  host;
- a representative old input still produces valid G-code. Compare toolpath
  structure and printer-relevant output, not raw byte equality, because engine
  builds can change ordering or metadata without an integration regression.

For this repository, the relevant local checks are:

```bash
npm run setup
npm run test
npm run build
npm run test:e2e
```

## Rollback

Rollback is a pin change, not a release mutation. Restore the previous
known-good `wasm-v2.4.2` asset pair, restore its cache key, and invalidate the
new service-worker cache entry. Keep both releases available so the rollback
can be reproduced and audited.

For the complete bridge examples, see the [Integration Guide](integration.md)
and [API Reference](api-reference.md). For upstream release context, see the
[OrcaSlicer v2.4.2 release](https://github.com/OrcaSlicer/OrcaSlicer/releases/tag/v2.4.2).
