/**
 * Vite build wrapper for Cloudflare Workers (static assets) deploys.
 *
 * Cloudflare cannot host the engine binaries itself: both slicer.wasm (~36 MB
 * ST) and slicer-mt.wasm (~36 MB MT) exceed Workers/Pages' 25 MiB per-file
 * static asset cap. GitHub Pages — the primary deployment, refreshed by
 * deploy.yml on every master push — already serves both variants with
 * `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` and `Content-Type: application/wasm`
 * (verified live; compileStreaming works, and the CORS header is what lets a
 * COEP-isolated Cloudflare page read the bytes cross-origin at all — plain
 * GitHub Releases assets send neither CORS nor CORP). So the Cloudflare build
 * points VITE_WASM_BASE_URL at the GitHub Pages copy instead of bundling
 * either engine, and ships only the app shell; `public/_headers` makes the
 * Cloudflare page cross-origin-isolated so the worker's runtime probe
 * (slicer.worker.ts) can select the MT engine there, while GitHub Pages
 * itself stays ST-only (it cannot send the COOP/COEP headers MT needs).
 *
 * The cache-busting key (VITE_WASM_VERSION) and header label
 * (VITE_ORCA_VERSION) come from the engine-version.json manifest that
 * deploy.yml publishes next to the wasm files on gh-pages — it carries the
 * same sha-based key and resolved label as the GitHub Pages deploy itself,
 * describing the exact bytes being served (not package.json, whose version
 * doesn't change when an engine-only fix ships — the staleness bug the ?v=
 * key exists to prevent; see vite.config.ts). Fallbacks, in order: the
 * GitHub Releases API (works but rate-limited from Cloudflare's shared
 * build egress IPs — the first live CF build hit exactly that), then the
 * app version. Resolution is best-effort and never fails the deploy.
 *
 * Run via `npm run build:cf` — this is what the Cloudflare Workers Builds
 * "build command" must be set to (see mkdocs-docs/architecture.md).
