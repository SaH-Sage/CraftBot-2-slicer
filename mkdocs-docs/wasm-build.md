# Building the WASM Engine

This page explains how to compile OrcaSlicer v2.4.2 to WebAssembly using the `orca-wasm/` build pipeline. You only need this if you want to change the C++ engine itself. For normal development of the web UI, download the pre-built artifacts with `node scripts/download-wasm.mjs`. For migrating a separate client frontend from the base release to the current immutable patch release, see [WASM Engine Migration](wasm-engine-migration.md).

## When to build

| Scenario | Action |
|----------|--------|
| Develop the React UI | `node scripts/download-wasm.mjs` — done |
| Change C++ bridge (`orca-wasm/bridge/slicer.cpp`) | Rebuild WASM |
| Update to a newer OrcaSlicer version | Rebuild WASM |
| Add or change an override stub or shim | Rebuild WASM |

## Artifacts

The build produces an ST pair and, in the matrix MT leg, an MT pair. They are
published as immutable GitHub Release assets. The first build for a given
OrcaSlicer version publishes `wasm-v2.4.2`; every later fix to `orca-wasm/`
for the *same* OrcaSlicer version (not an upstream bump) publishes
`wasm-v2.4.2-patch1`, `-patch2`, etc. as a brand-new release rather than
overwriting the previous one — `deploy.yml` resolves whichever has the highest
patch number at deploy time. Each release's description includes an
auto-generated changelog: the list of commits touching `orca-wasm/**` or the
build workflow since the previous `wasm-*` release.

| File | Size | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| `slicer.wasm` | ~38 MB | Compiled OrcaSlicer v2.4.2 core + OCCT (STEP engine), single-threaded (ST) |
| `slicer.js` | ~220 KB | Emscripten glue code (CommonJS IIFE), ST |
| `slicer-mt.wasm` | ~37 MB | The same engine linked against real oneTBB, multithreaded (MT) |
| `slicer-mt.js` | ~250 KB | Emscripten glue code, MT |

There is no `slicer.data` — the headless flat-config slicer never reads `orca/resources` at runtime, so the 200 MB preload file was eliminated entirely.

## Build pipeline

                                                calls; a build that compiles
                                                but traps never reaches the
                                                release step (ADR-009)
```

Dependencies are cached between runs (GitHub Actions cache key based on dependency versions). A cold build (deps + compile) takes ~2.5–3 h, of which OCCT alone is ~45–60 min. With warm dep and `ccache` caches, a build that only touches C++ source takes ~10–15 min.

## Triggering a build

=== "GitHub Actions (recommended)"

    Supported ways to trigger:

    - **Manual dispatch:** go to **Actions → Build WASM → Run workflow**, enter the upstream OrcaSlicer tag (e.g. `v2.4.2`), and run.
    - **Push to `master`:** changes under `orca-wasm/**` or the workflow automatically build and publish the next immutable patch release for the pinned upstream version.

    Both paths:

    1. Build and cache dependencies
    2. Check out the OrcaSlicer submodule at the specified tag
    3. Apply `patches/apply.py`
    4. Compile with `cmake + ninja`
    5. Run `orca-wasm/scripts/smoke-test.mjs` against the freshly built engine (see [ADR-009](adr/adr-009-wasm-smoke-test.md)) — a build that compiles but fails this step never reaches the next one
    6. Publish artifacts to the corresponding GitHub Release

    Builds on pull requests that touch `orca-wasm/**` run automatically but skip the release-publish step (the smoke test still runs).

=== "Local (Linux / macOS / WSL2)"

    Windows users: WSL2 works well for this (Windows-native emsdk + this dep
    chain is a much rockier path — Boost's `b2`, GMP/MPFR's `configure`, and
    OCCT's CMake all assume a POSIX toolchain).

    ```bash
    # Install build tools (Arch example — use your distro's equivalents).
    # clang is required in addition to base-devel's gcc: Boost's b2 engine
    # bootstraps with `--with-toolset=clang`, so a clang++ must be on PATH
    # (the actual WASM compile still goes through em++).
    pacman -S --needed git cmake ninja python m4 texinfo openssl ccache clang base-devel

    # Install emsdk (pinned to match CI — see EMSDK_VERSION in build-wasm.yml)
    git clone https://github.com/emscripten-core/emsdk.git /opt/emsdk
    /opt/emsdk/emsdk install 3.1.74 && /opt/emsdk/emsdk activate 3.1.74

    # Clone the repo and build — run from the repo root, not orca-wasm/
    git clone https://github.com/Hiosdra/OrcaWeb.git && cd OrcaWeb
    ./orca-wasm/scripts/build-local-wsl.sh
    ```

    This script is generated from `.github/workflows/build-wasm.yml` itself
    (via `node scripts/gen-wsl-build-script.mjs`), so it stays accurate as the
    CI pipeline changes — re-run the generator after editing the workflow
    rather than hand-editing the script. First run builds all dependencies
    from scratch (~90–100 min, mostly OCCT); subsequent runs skip
    already-built deps via stamp files in `orca-wasm/deps-install/`, and
    `ccache` (set up automatically, `~/.cache/ccache`) makes repeat C++
    compiles of unchanged files fast.

    CI builds both the `st` (single-threaded) and `mt` (multithreaded,
    real oneTBB + pthreads — see [ADR-011](adr/adr-011-multithreaded-engine.md))
    variants as separate matrix legs; this script builds one at a time and
    defaults to the ST fallback for local convenience. To reproduce the
    primary product engine, build the MT variant explicitly:

    ```bash
    WASM_VARIANT=mt ./orca-wasm/scripts/build-local-wsl.sh
    ```

    Artifacts land directly in `public/wasm/slicer.js` / `slicer.wasm` (st)
    or `slicer-mt.js` / `slicer-mt.wasm` (mt) (also copied to
    `wasm-artifacts/` to mirror the CI upload step) — no manual copy needed.

    If emsdk lives somewhere other than `/opt/emsdk`, point the script at it
    with `EMSDK=/path/to/emsdk ./orca-wasm/scripts/build-local-wsl.sh`.

## Applying patches before build

`patches/apply.py` patches the OrcaSlicer source tree to make it compile under Emscripten. It is safe to run multiple times (idempotent):

```bash
python3 orca-wasm/patches/apply.py        # apply all patches
python3 orca-wasm/patches/apply.py --check  # dry-run — print what would change
```

See [Architecture → Engine clean layer](architecture.md#engine-clean-layer-override-approach) for the full list of what each patch does.

## Two non-obvious gotchas

### Boost.Log namespace mismatch (`v2s_st` vs `v2s_mt_posix`)

**Symptom:** hundreds of `undefined symbol: boost::log::v2s_mt_posix::*` from `wasm-ld`.

**Cause:** Boost must be built with `BOOST_LOG_NO_THREADS=1`, which puts log symbols in the `v2s_st` namespace. If the libslic3r consumer doesn't define the same flag it expects `v2s_mt_posix` — ABI mismatch.

**Fix:** `BOOST_LOG_NO_THREADS=1` is set for **both** the Boost build (`b2 define=BOOST_LOG_NO_THREADS`) and the libslic3r build (via `add_compile_definitions()` in `orca-wasm/cmake/wasm_find_paths.cmake`). The `utils.cpp` patch replaces `synchronous_sink` → `unlocked_sink` and removes the `[Thread …]` log field, which don't exist in the single-thread Boost build.

### `-sEMULATE_FUNCTION_POINTER_CASTS=1` crashes `wasm-opt`

**Symptom:** SIGABRT in `mixed_arena.h:188` (Binaryen) during the `--fpcast-emu` optimisation pass at `-O3`. The `wasm-ld` link step succeeds; only the optimiser crashes.

**Fix:** the flag is not used. Removed from `orca-wasm/wasm/CMakeLists.txt`. The module instantiates and slices correctly without the function-pointer-cast emulator — no runtime traps have been observed.

## Updating the OrcaSlicer version

1. Update `ORCA_VERSION` in `.github/workflows/build-wasm.yml`
2. Update the submodule: `git -C orca-wasm/orca checkout v<new-version>`
3. Re-run `patches/apply.py --check` and fix any patch failures
4. Trigger the `Build WASM` workflow
5. Update the release tag in `deploy.yml` and `scripts/download-wasm.mjs`
