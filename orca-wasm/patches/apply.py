"""
Apply WASM compatibility changes to the OrcaSlicer source tree.

Strategy
--------
* CMakeLists.txt files are patched in-place (unavoidable — OrcaSlicer has no
  upstream WASM build support).
* C++ *stub .cpp* files (OCCT, OpenVDB, OpenCV, Draco) are NOT
  modified.  The CMake injection in section 4c marks originals as
  HEADER_FILE_ONLY and adds our override implementations from
  ``orca-wasm/overrides/``.
* C++ *stub .hpp* files whose originals include unavailable headers (OCCT,
  OpenVDB, OpenCV) ARE copied from ``orca-wasm/overrides/`` directly into
  the orca/ source tree (section 4b).  GCC/Clang always search the including
  file's directory before any -I path, so the only reliable override is to
  replace the file in-place.  The canonical stub source remains in overrides/.
* C++ *bugfixes* (narrowing, Eigen deduction, Boost.Log, Platform assert,
  thumbnail jpg→png) are still patched in-place; these are genuine
  compatibility issues that should be upstreamed to OrcaSlicer.

#     junctions (the for-loop over `line` never executes), and that

# 8f. WallToolPaths.hpp — default-initialize WallToolPathsParams fields
#     Next crash after 8e (same UBSan location, unchanged): min_length_factor
#     itself DOES have a documented fallback in make_paths_params() (0.5f),
#     but min_bead_width, min_feature_size and wall_transition_length are
#     only conditionally assigned there with NO else-fallback — if the
#     corresponding print_object_config option isn't present (our headless
#     WASM build ships no bundled profile JSON, unlike a real OrcaSlicer
#     install), those fields stay uninitialized garbage. Rather than chase
#     exactly which uninitialized field's garbage bit pattern produces the
#     observed NaN in this particular build, default-initialize the whole
#     struct to the same values make_paths_params() already documents as
#     intended fallbacks (or 0/false for the ones with none documented) —
#     a normal, idiomatic fix that only changes behavior for previously-UB
#     construction paths.
#
#     The four percent-of-nozzle-diameter fields (min_bead_width,
#     min_feature_size, wall_transition_length, wall_transition_filter_
#     deviation) were originally zeroed here — that's NOT what "no override
#     present" means upstream. PrintConfig.cpp defines real, deliberately
#     non-zero defaults for these (min_bead_width 85%, min_feature_size 25%,
#     wall_transition_length 100%, wall_transition_filter_deviation 25%, all
#     as a percentage of nozzle diameter; wall_transition_angle 10 degrees
#     flat, not percent-based). Zero for wall_transition_length/angle in
#     particular tells Arachne to allow a wall-count transition at every
#     infinitesimal width change instead of upstream's intended ~1-nozzle-
#     width/10-degree smoothing window — on simple geometry (no width
#     variation) this is inert, but zero values would tell Arachne to allow
#     a wall-count transition at every infinitesimal width change instead of
#     upstream's intended ~1-nozzle-width/10-degree smoothing window. Every
#     printer profile this app ships uses a 0.4mm nozzle (see
#     src/data/orca-profiles.json), so hardcode each percent-based default
#     as its absolute-mm equivalent for 0.4mm rather than 0.
#
#     NOTE (2026-07-07): this patch was originally believed to also fix the
#     Voron Design Cube multi-minute hang. It does not — the hang reproduces
#     with these exact params passed explicitly through the config (and
#     orc_init starts from FullPrintConfig defaults anyway, so
#     make_paths_params() never actually sees a missing option). The real
#     cause was Boost.Log's broken default sink amplifying Arachne's
#     per-edge warning storm — see the DisableBoostLogOnInit comment in
#     orca-wasm/bridge/slicer.cpp. This patch stays as defensive
#     initialization for genuinely-uninitialized construction paths.

# 8g. Thread.cpp — stub thread naming on Emscripten instead of linking a
#     real pthread_setname_np
#     Thread.cpp's generic "posix" branch (the #else after the __APPLE__
#     special-case) calls pthread_setname_np()/pthread_getname_np()
#     unconditionally on any non-Windows/non-Apple platform, which includes
#     Emscripten (it defines the usual posix macros). This build is
#     single-threaded (see ADR-007 — no real pthreads), so these symbols
#     don't exist; normal Release linking has so far gotten away with it
#     because nothing reachable from an ordinary slice calls set_thread_name()
#     — wasm-ld's --gc-sections silently drops the whole function, symbol and
#     all, before it ever needs to resolve. That's fragile, not fixed: adding
#     -fsanitize=undefined (for UBSan diagnostic builds — see
#     .github/workflows/build-wasm-debug.yml) changes what the linker keeps
#     live, and the same dead code becomes a real "undefined symbol:
#     pthread_setname_np" link failure. Give Emscripten its own no-op branch
#     (matching the existing __APPLE__ "not supported" pattern immediately
#     above it) so the symbol is never referenced at all, regardless of what
#     the linker decides to keep.
