!!! note "Version drift is expected in ADR titles/content"
    ADR-004's title and body reference OrcaSlicer v2.4.0, the version pinned
    at the time that decision was made. Routine OrcaSlicer version bumps
    (v2.4.0 → **v2.4.2**, currently shipped) don't get their own ADR — see
    [status.md](../status.md) for the version actually running in
    production.
