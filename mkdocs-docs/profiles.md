# Profiles

## OrcaSlicer profile format

OrcaSlicer stores print profiles as JSON files with a `type` field indicating whether the file describes a **machine**, **filament**, or **process** (print settings).

```json
{
  "type": "process",
  "name": "0.20mm Standard @BBL X1C",
  "inherits": "fdm_process_common",
  "layer_height": "0.2",
  "wall_loops": "3",
  "sparse_infill_density": "15%",
  "sparse_infill_pattern": "gyroid",
  "outer_wall_speed": "150",
  "enable_support": "0"
}
```

!!! note "String encoding"
    OrcaSlicer encodes all values as strings, even numbers (`"0.2"` not `0.2`) and booleans (`"1"` not `true`). Percentages use the `%` suffix (`"15%"`). OrcaWeb's parser handles all of these automatically.

## Where to find profile files

=== "Windows"
    ```
    %APPDATA%\OrcaSlicer\user\default\machine\
    %APPDATA%\OrcaSlicer\user\default\filament\
    %APPDATA%\OrcaSlicer\user\default\process\
    ```

=== "macOS"
    ```
    ~/Library/Application Support/OrcaSlicer/user/default/machine/
    ~/Library/Application Support/OrcaSlicer/user/default/filament/
    ~/Library/Application Support/OrcaSlicer/user/default/process/
    ```

=== "Linux"
    ```
    ~/.config/OrcaSlicer/user/default/machine/
    ~/.config/OrcaSlicer/user/default/filament/
    ~/.config/OrcaSlicer/user/default/process/
    ```

## Field mapping

OrcaWeb maps OrcaSlicer profile fields to its internal `OrcaConfig`. Aliases from different OrcaSlicer versions are handled.

| OrcaSlicer field | OrcaConfig key | Notes |
|-----------------|---------------|-------|
| `layer_height` | `layer_height` | mm |
| `initial_layer_print_height` | `initial_layer_print_height` | mm; `initial_layer_height` is the SLA-only field |
| `wall_loops` / `perimeters` | `wall_loops` | |
| `top_shell_layers` | `top_shell_layers` | |
| `bottom_shell_layers` | `bottom_shell_layers` | |
| `sparse_infill_density` / `fill_density` | `sparse_infill_density` | `%` stripped |
| `sparse_infill_pattern` / `fill_pattern` | `sparse_infill_pattern` | |
| `outer_wall_speed` / `external_perimeter_speed` | `outer_wall_speed` | mm/s |
| `default_speed` / `inner_wall_speed` | `default_speed` | mm/s |
| `travel_speed` | `travel_speed` | mm/s |
| `initial_layer_speed` / `first_layer_speed` | `initial_layer_speed` | mm/s |
| `brim_width` | `brim_width` | mm |
| `seam_position` | `seam_position` | |
| `enable_support` | `enable_support` | `"1"` → true |
| `support_type` | `support_type` | |
| `fuzzy_skin` | `fuzzy_skin` | `"none"` / `"external"` / `"all"` |
| `fuzzy_skin_thickness` | `fuzzy_skin_thickness` | mm |
| `fuzzy_skin_point_dist` | `fuzzy_skin_point_dist` | mm |
| `enable_ironing` / `ironing` | `enable_ironing` | |
| `filament_type` | `filament_type` | filament profiles |
| `nozzle_temperature` / `temperature` | `nozzle_temperature` | °C |
| `bed_temperature` / `hot_plate_temp` | `bed_temperature` | °C |
| `fan_min_speed` | `fan_min_speed` | 0–100 |
| `printer_model` | `printer_model` | machine profiles |
| `nozzle_diameter` | `nozzle_diameter` | mm |
| `printable_area` | `bed_size_x` + `bed_size_y` | array of `"XxY"` corner strings; max X/Y taken as bed dimensions |
| `bed_size` | `bed_size_x` + `bed_size_y` | legacy format: `["W","H"]` or `"WxH"` |
| `printable_height` / `max_print_height` | `printable_height` | max Z height in mm |

Fields not in this table are **forwarded verbatim to the WASM slicer** (passthrough) rather than silently ignored. This means all machine-profile fields recognised by OrcaSlicer — `gcode_flavor`, `retract_length`, `retract_speed`, `lift_z`, `machine_start_gcode`, `machine_end_gcode`, `layer_change_gcode`, `machine_max_speed_*`, and more — reach the engine automatically when importing a machine profile JSON.

## 3MF profile extraction

OrcaSlicer saves complete project files as `.3mf` archives. When you load a 3MF in OrcaWeb, the profile extraction pipeline:

1. Unpacks the ZIP archive using [fflate](https://github.com/101arrowz/fflate)
2. Finds all files under `Metadata/` matching `*.json` or `*.config` (case-insensitive)
3. Sorts them by specificity: machine → filament → process → project (later wins on conflicts)
4. Parses each through the same `parseOrcaProfileJson` pipeline as manual imports
5. Merges into a single `Partial<OrcaConfig>` applied as overrides

The mesh geometry (`3D/3dmodel.model`) is converted from the 3MF XML format to binary STL transparently — the WASM slicer receives a standard STL.

## Settings precedence

Every value OrcaWeb slices with comes from one of three layers. Later layers win, field by field:

| # | Layer | Where it comes from | Replaced when |
|---|-------|--------------------|---------------|
| 1 | **Preset** | The selected printer + filament + quality preset | You pick a different printer, filament or quality preset |
| 2 | **Imported file** | Settings embedded in a `.3mf`, or an imported `.json` OrcaSlicer profile/profile set | You import another file/set, remove it, or change a complete imported printer context |
| 3 | **Your edits** | Any field you changed by hand in the settings panel | Only by you — per-field **reset**, **Reset all**, or loading a saved preset |

The rule that matters in daily use is the third row: **a setting you changed by hand survives everything underneath it.** Switch printer, switch filament, switch quality preset, load a different 3MF — your edited fields stay exactly as you left them, and only the fields you never touched follow the new profile. This matches desktop OrcaSlicer, where a modified setting stays modified (and stays flagged) as you switch presets around it.

Edited fields are marked in the panel with an amber outline and a **reset** button that drops that one override and reveals the profile's own value again. A summary at the top of the panel counts them and offers **Reset all**.

!!! warning "Loading a saved preset is the one exception"
    "My presets" stores a complete selection — printer, filament, quality preset *and* the manual edits that were active when you saved it. Loading one therefore replaces all three layers, including your current edits.

A field left unset in all three layers is not sent to the engine at all; OrcaSlicer then resolves it from its own built-in default. The number shown in the panel for such a field is a display-only default that deliberately matches that engine default — see `DISPLAY_DEFAULTS` in `src/lib/profiles.ts`.

The layer model itself lives in [`src/lib/config-layers.ts`](https://github.com/Hiosdra/OrcaWeb/blob/master/src/lib/config-layers.ts), which is the single place this order is defined and the only thing that may change it.

## Import behaviour

When you import a profile or profile set:

1. OrcaWeb reads every selected JSON and validates it before changing state
2. Recognised fields are exposed in the UI; remaining OrcaSlicer fields are collected and forwarded verbatim to the WASM slicer when their vector shape is complete
3. The extracted settings become one **imported** layer — above the preset selection, below your own edits
4. A confirmation message shows either the profile name/type or the number and types of files in the set
5. You can still manually adjust individual settings after importing, and those adjustments outrank the file/set

Importing another profile or set replaces the previous imported layer atomically. A malformed file or an ambiguous duplicate category leaves the previous import untouched. It does not touch settings you edited by hand.

!!! tip "Machine profiles"
    Import a machine profile JSON from your OrcaSlicer installation (`%APPDATA%\OrcaSlicer\user\default\machine\` on Windows) to transfer the full printer configuration — G-code dialect, retraction, Z-hop, start/end G-code scripts, and kinematics limits — to the browser slicer.

## Complete local profile sets

OrcaSlicer stores a real selection as separate JSON files. The **Import profiles
(.json)** picker accepts several files in one operation:

- at most one `machine`, `process`, or `print` file;
- one `filament` file per material slot;
- duplicate machine/process/print categories are rejected before any state changes;
- known materials use the preset order (PLA, PETG, ABS, TPU), so slot order does not depend on the order returned by the operating system;
- a missing `filament_type` is inferred from the filament name or its `inherits` value, which is common in leaf profiles.

The importer preserves multi-value arrays such as `nozzle_diameter`,
`filament_type`, temperatures, filament IDs, and filament-specific G-code. On a
machine profile with two nozzle diameters, the first two material slots are
mapped to physical extruders 1 and 2. The app does not connect to or upload to
the printer; the result is downloaded as G-code from the Slice tab.

Because a complete set carries vectors for a fixed material list, changing that
list (adding/removing a slot or choosing another material) removes the imported
set atomically before the new selection is used. This prevents a custom flow,
pressure-advance value, or filament G-code hook from being applied to a
different material; import the set again after making such a change.

### Example Voron backup

For a dual-nozzle Voron backup, select the machine, process, and filament files
together. The directory name below is only an example; replace `sample-user`
with the directory name in your own backup:

```text
orcaslicer/user/sample-user/machine/Voron 0.4.json
orcaslicer/user/sample-user/process/0.20mm Tuned.json
orcaslicer/user/sample-user/filament/Voron PLA.json
orcaslicer/user/sample-user/filament/Voron PETG.json
```

The `default/machine/Voron 2.4 350 0.4 nozzle - Copy.json` file is an
alternative machine profile, not an additional layer; selecting both machine
files is intentionally rejected as ambiguous. `hints.cereal` is not a profile
JSON and should not be selected.

The backup's leaf profiles use `inherits`. OrcaWeb does not fetch private parent
profiles or require GitHub credentials: values present in the selected leaf
files are preserved, while omitted values continue to come from the selected
built-in preset/engine defaults. For a production print, check the resulting
printer dimensions, nozzle diameter, temperatures, start/end G-code, and
extruder assignment against the same selection in desktop OrcaSlicer before
starting the first job.

For a partially specified per-filament option, the importer uses the pinned
OrcaSlicer engine default (or the selected built-in material default where one
exists). An unknown option that is present in only some filament leaves is
omitted rather than copied to another material; this is safer than producing a
short vector with the wrong slot mapping.

## Built-in presets

OrcaWeb ships with minimal built-in presets for common printers and materials.

### Printer presets

| Preset | Model | Nozzle | Bed (X × Y) |
|--------|-------|--------|-------------|
| Generic 0.4 | Generic | 0.4 mm | 256 × 256 mm |
| Generic 0.6 | Generic | 0.6 mm | 256 × 256 mm |
| Bambu Lab P1S | BambuLab P1S | 0.4 mm | 256 × 256 mm |
| Bambu Lab X1C | BambuLab X1C | 0.4 mm | 256 × 256 mm |
| Creality Ender 3 | Creality Ender-3 | 0.4 mm | 220 × 220 mm |
| Prusa MK4 | Prusa MK4 | 0.4 mm | 250 × 210 mm |
| Voron 2.4 | Voron 2.4 | 0.4 mm | 300 × 300 mm |

Bed dimensions are also read from the `printable_area` field of an imported profile (or 3MF machine metadata), overriding the preset values.

### Quality presets

| Preset | Layer height | Walls | Infill |
|--------|-------------|-------|--------|
| Draft | 0.3 mm | 2 | 10% |
| Standard | 0.2 mm | 3 | 15% |
| Fine | 0.1 mm | 4 | 20% |
